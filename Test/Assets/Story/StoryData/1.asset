  - text: Once upon a time, in a small town nestled in the countryside, there lived
      a young boy named Ethan Sullivan. From an early age, Ethan was captivated by
      the mysteries of the universe. He would spend countless hours gazing at the
      stars, dreaming of venturing beyond Earth's boundaries. His imagination soared
      as he devoured books on space exploration, idolizing astronauts and their daring
      expeditions.
